My name is Masumi Yano. I am an undergraduate researcher at [University of Washington Tacoma](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/set/programs/undergrad/css) with interest in computer vision and generative ai. I am currently doing research with amazing people in [Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/mdecock/ppml/), as well as with [Professor Damiano Torre](https://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/dctorre) to utilize diffusion model to purify the hidden threats in data to mitigate cyberattacks. 
I have multiple computer vision project in my [Github](https://github.com/MasumiYano), and I am currently working on creating my own implementation of diffusion model to understand the concept better.

Research Interest
======
1. Advancing multi-modal Computer Vision. Integrate vision with langauge to improve semantic understanding.
2. Explore Generative AI application in structured decision-making.
3. Explore application of these technologies in real-world scenarios.
