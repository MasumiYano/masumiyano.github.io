My name is Masumi Yano. I am an undergraduate researcher at [University of Washington Tacoma](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/set/programs/undergrad/css) with interest in computer vision and generative ai. I am currently doing research with amazing people in [Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/mdecock/ppml/), as well as with [Professor Damiano Torre](https://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/dctorre) to utilize diffusion model to purify the hidden threats in data to mitigate cyberattacks. 
I have multiple computer vision project in my [Github](https://github.com/MasumiYano), and I am currently working on creating my own implementation of diffusion model to understand the concept better.

Research Interest
======
**Research In Computer Vision**: I'm interested in computer vision, which began while reading a machine learning book to chatch up with Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning lab. Although there are no professors specializing in computer vision at my campus, I audited a class from another campus to learn more about the field. In computer vision research, I aim to apply computer vision to improve accessibility for those in need.  

**Research In Generative AI**: I'm interested in generative AI, which deepened during the last class of the CV class. To better understand the concept, I read about Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) paper after the class. I believe there are many applications for diffusion models, and I'm excited to explore them further.
